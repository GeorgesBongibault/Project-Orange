# Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets
## Project-Orange
Team Orange uses this page for updating progress on the data mining class project.

## Project description
Given tweets on the subject of disasters, we will build a Machine Learning model that should predict which tweets are about a real disaster and which are not.


### Week 1
- Discovered the project
- Created Repository with test and training data
- Created a Slack channel for discussion
- Started the notebook, computed the base rate (57%) on 6471 samples in the training data

### Week 2
- Ran basic prediction with 0.8 accuracy on our test part of the training data
- Submitted and got 0.819 test accuracy
- Did the EDA : top keywords and locations, top keywords and locations with the most real and fake tweets
- Delete doubling, usernames and hastags and see a slight decrease in accuracy (0.8003)

### Week 3
- pooling of our codes
- testing of vectorizer configs
- testing of the RandomForest, with no improvement for the moment

### Week 4
- optimizing the hyperparameters of logistic regression, tf-idf and random forest
- testing KNN, with still no improvement from logistic regression for the moment
- searched for stopwords and slangs lists
- None of our submissions were better than the first one
